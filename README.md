This is an Interactive Resume built so as to demonstrate and extend in future , as to how I would want my resume to look like - dynamic and lively!

Built using Html , CSS and JavaScript 

Some key highlights - 
- Ripple Effect in the background around the heading area
- Dynamic counter - the counter refreshes itself as user reloads the site
- Moving Carousel - The carousel moves and updates itself over the next slide, showing reviews and work I have done

You may access the website live at Github Pages https://anubxv.github.io/interactive-resume/
